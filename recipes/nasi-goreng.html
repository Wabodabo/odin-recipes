        Nasi Goreng is a delicious Indonesian version of Fried Rice. Like any other fried rice recipe, it can contain a number of ingredients. This not only makes it a very easy dish to make, but also allows to you add anything you like specifically!

        This recipe will be how my mother taught it, and it's <strong>delicious!</strong> In case you want to add anything else, feel free. The recipe below will be rather spicy, so if that's not your thing, just add less sambal.
